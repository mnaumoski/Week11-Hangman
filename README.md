# Week11-Hangman

Overview: In this assignment, the Hangman homework from Week 2 is empowered with JavaScript constructors.

1. This Hangman game will run entirely with Node.js.

2. Both letter.js and word.js should be constructor files:
- word.js should contain all of the methods which will check the letters guessed versus the random word selected.
- letter.js should control whether or not a letter appears as a "_" or as itself on-screen.
- game.js file will randomly select a word for the player.
- main.js will contain the logic of the app. Running it in Terminal/Bash will start the game.

3. The app should end when a player guesses the correct word or runs out of guesses.
